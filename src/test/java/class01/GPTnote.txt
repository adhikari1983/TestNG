TestNG stands for
"Next Generation Testing," and it is an open-source testing framework for Java, that is inspired by JUnit and NUnit.
It is widely used for automating and managing test cases in Java-based applications. It offers several advanced features
and functionalities compared to traditional  testing frameworks like JUnit.
It is designed to make it easy to write and run tests for Java applications, whether they are unit tests or
functional/integration tests.

TestNG provides a wide range of features that go beyond what is offered by traditional testing frameworks.
Some key features of TestNG include:

Annotations:
TestNG uses annotations to define test methods, test classes, test suites, and configuration methods. Annotations such
as @Test, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, etc., provide flexibility in organizing and controlling the test execution flow.

Test Configuration:
TestNG allows the configuration of test suites, which are groups of tests that can be executed together. Configuration
methods, marked with annotations such as @BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, etc., can be used to define
setup and teardown operations for tests.

Test Dependency:
TestNG supports test dependency management. Tests can be set up to depend on the successful execution of other tests or
groups of tests, ensuring proper order and dependency resolution during test execution.

Data-driven Testing:
TestNG enables data-driven testing by allowing the use of various data providers, such as @DataProvider, to supply test
data from external sources like XML, Excel, CSV, databases, etc. This allows tests to be executed with different data
sets.

Parallel Execution:
TestNG provides built-in support for parallel test execution. It allows tests to be run in parallel on multiple threads,
maximizing test execution efficiency and reducing overall test execution time.

Reporting:
TestNG generates detailed HTML and XML reports that provide insights into test execution results, including test case
status, execution time, logs, and failures. These reports can be easily customized and integrated with build systems
and Continuous Integration (CI) tools.

TestNG is widely used in the Java ecosystem and is supported by various IDEs, build tools, and CI servers. It provides
a powerful and flexible framework for testing Java applications and offers features that can enhance test organization,
maintainability, and execution efficiency.
